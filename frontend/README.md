# Premium Jewelry Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Product Image Guidelines

### Importance of Image Consistency

To maintain trust with our customers and provide an accurate representation of our products, it is crucial that:

- **The jewelry shown in model images must exactly match the jewelry in product images**
- Each product must have both a product image (showing the jewelry item clearly) and a model image (showing the same jewelry being worn)
- The model image should showcase the same exact jewelry piece, not a similar or different version

### Image Display

The application implements a hover effect on product cards:
- By default, the product image is displayed
- On hover, the model image fades in, showing the same jewelry being worn
- In the product details modal, both images are displayed side by side

### Backend Validation

The backend API includes validation to ensure consistency between product and model images:
- When creating or updating products, both images are validated
- In a production environment, AI-based image recognition would be used to verify that the same jewelry appears in both images

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
